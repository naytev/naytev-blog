It seems that critiques deriding BuzzFeed as little more than cat pics and clickbait have subsided, but as the viral phenomenon has grown and matured, it's evolved into a new breed of media company. As CEO Jonah Peretti often points out, they are pioneering a new model of content creation and distribution, but its' amorphous nature makes it difficult to categorize. Operating outside the traditional bounds of an owned and earned property, we might ask what is BuzzFeed? A network? A style? Something else entirely?

Let's start with the easiest distinction: traditional media companies own their primary distribution channel. Whether we're talking about broadcast television, print journalism, or a website like the New York Times, the center point for this model is a property upon which the audience can be measured and monetized, typically through advertising. BuzzFeed's model is different, as 95% of their content engagement happens in places they do not own, mainly social channels. 

This concept is easiest to illustrate when comparing the extremes. [NowThisNews](https://nowthisnews.com/), for example, is entirely distributed, meaning all of their content is produced for and consumed on social media. Their website has no content and simply announces: "HOMEPAGE. EVEN THE WORD SOUNDS OLD. TODAY THE NEWS LIVES WHERE YOU LIVE." (caps theirs). At the opposite end of the spectrum are sites with paywalls like the Wall Street Journal, who rely very little on channels outside their destination website for traffic. BuzzFeed, like NowThis, treats social channels as primary channels for distribution, and considers their website to be only 5% of their focus.

While almost every major publication relies on social media to some extent for traffic, the major difference is that most traditional publications use these networks as a way to drive traffic back to their websites, while BuzzFeed creates network-specific content to be consumed within the contexts of those platforms. This is evident in the way they describe themselves, as "a global, cross-platform, tech-driven network generating FIVE BILLION monthly content views from our site, multiple BuzzFeed apps, and over 30 other platforms". That is a commitment to meet users where they are, and produce content for a media world that is [shifting away from websites](/publishers-must-adapt/).

> BuzzFeed: "Today we are a global, cross-platform, tech-driven network generating FIVE BILLION monthly content views from our site, multiple BuzzFeed apps, and over 30 other platforms including Facebook video, YouTube, and Snapchat."

It's clear from this that BuzzFeed is more than just a website, but it also goes beyond a collection of social media accounots with shared branding. Despite packaging content appropriately for each network, there is a distinct BuzzFeed personality to all of their content, regardless of outlet. This lends brand consistency across their large, fragmented distribution footprint, and makes their content quickly recognizable. 

Relatedly, the audience defines what BuzzFeed is as much as the distribution channels, a fact that is not lost upon investors. BuzzFeed has [raised hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/buzzfeed#/entity) because in addition to gathering a large audience, they know how to engage them in a coordinated way across all of these channels.

At SXSW 2016 in March, CMO Frank Cooper (pictured above) [announced Swarm](http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/buzzfeed-launches-new-ad-format-further-monetize-its-big-social-reach-170172), which "allows advertisers to run campaigns simultaneously across all of his company's Web and mobile properties and six of its social platforms: Snapchat Discover, Vine, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr." This is why BuzzFeed works outside of a traditional owned and earned property: they are able to parley the value of a coordinated cross-channel media push into enormous measurable value for their clients, without relying on plastering tired banner ads across the homepage. 

So what is BuzzFeed? Here are four main key components:
1. Cross-channel distribution infrastructure
2. Large and Engaged Audience
3. Cohesive Content Style & Branding
4. Nimble tech able to operate in rapidly shifting media landscape

In a single sentence, BuzzFeed is a cohesive content creation and curation machine paired with a tech stack capable of delivering content to and engaging a large audience across a fragmented, multi-channel media landscape. 

Put more simply, BuzzFeed is the first winning example of what a successful media company looks like in life after websites.
