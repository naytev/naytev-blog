There are many tools available for A/B testing, and depending on your needs, budget, and application, the right tool may differ. Here's a summary of a few of the best tools for each category of testing.

## Website A/B Testing

* **Optimizely**

Optimizely is the 800lb Gorilla of A/B testing. They have offer free plans as well as full Enterprise support. Optimizely has a reputation for being easy to set up, simple to use, and effective for improving performance.

* **Visual Website Optimizer**

Visual Website Optimizer is a less expensive alternative to Optimizely, but doesn't offer the same range of features or ease of use. For serious A/B testers, it's probably not going to be sufficient.
